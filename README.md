# Basic Angular Form

This project was made as an exercise for Becode Antwerp as an introduction to Angular.


Start the entire project with ng serve.

To start the node server and see all added friends, run the command node server in the CLI 
when cd'd into the server directory. Surf to localhost:9020/addedFriends

Current functionality : saving form input data to localhost:9020/addedFriends
It currently loses the stored data and works like a session.



Overall current thoughts on the projects and Angular :

Angular is very confusing to me compared to React. While both of these have a learning curve
and I struggle with them, React just makes more sense organically to me. 
The whole predetermined structure while only working in a few files was very annoying and 
confusing to navigate for me. The steps for the exercise were doable for me until I started struggling
around steps 15 and 16. 


This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.1.1.
